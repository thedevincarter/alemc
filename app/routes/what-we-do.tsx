            Allegiance LEMC is a proud supporter of Breast Cancer Awareness. We give back to local families in our community that have been affected by this terrible disease. We believe money raised in the community should stay in the community.

The Allegiance LEMC will host a wide variety of fundraising events. Some examples may include, but shall not be limited to: motorcycle runs, bike washes, sales of items and services, food and clothing drives, recycling programs, collections of items, and breakfasts/brunches/lunches/dinners. Donations collected by these events will be dispersed to other 501 (c) (3) charities, private foundations, accounts established for tragedy stricken families, and families or individuals where medical and/or therapeutic needs have arisen.
